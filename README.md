# Set's algorithms repository

## What is this repo?

Hi! Welcome to my algorithms repository :)

I'm (always) learning algorithms, and this is the repository where I'm putting them, both so I can see my progress and so I can have an easy reference to any algorithm I have personally written specifically in this format.

## How can I use it?

You can look around here to have a very sensible reference to some popular algorithms.

You could also give me some tips both on algorithms and on Python. I'd really appreciate it. If you'd like to do so, read the [contributing file](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can clone the repo and mess around too. I'm trying to have tests for everything, so you can run then with Pytest.

## Why Python?

Currently I'm working on frontend development, with ReactJS + Next, but I've decided to create this in Python, for two reasons:
  1. Python is easy to read.
       * Python is very aesthetic to me, and it's a very beginner friendly language, so I can point whatever newcomer I see to here if they need some help.
  2. I wanna learn Python.
      * Well, it's very popular, and it's always good to have more tools in your toolkit. This is a very good opportunity to learn Python while I'm learning algorithms. Plus, the book I'm reading uses Python examples, so it's easier for me to transpile whatever I see on the book, although I'm rarely using the exact same implementation, since I'm aiming towards more generic implementations, using recursion whenever I feel like it.

## License

I'm hardly the author of anything here. Those implementations are under [MIT's open source license](LICENSE.md).
